# Rouge Rogue
# Fork of the simsim discord bot

This is a fork of https://github.com/Sakimori/matteo-the-prestige, a project for simulating Blaseball games. Go check it out, because most of the work was done there. This fork is a personal project meant to add additional functionality, mostly in terms of statistics.

## FAQ:
- Q: Why have the teams in my league played an uneven amount of games/why are some teams not scheduled for games for some weeks?  
  A (From original FAQ): Scheduling algorithms are really hard and the way xvi chose to do it involves some teams having byes for some series of the season, it'll even out by the end and every team will play the same number of games.
  
- Q: My league stopped playing randomly and I don't know why, what should I do?  
  A (From original FAQ): There were probably server issues or a patch went out, use the startleague command again and things should resume from where they left off.

- Q: What should I do if my question isn't answered by this FAQ, this readme, or the help text for the commands, or I find a bug?  
  A: Your best bet is to DM @anonezumi#9912 on Discord or make an issue on the repo. Try seeing if your issue also applies to the original bot, in which case follow the instructions on that repo instead.
